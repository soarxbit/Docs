# Soarx Token (SOARX)

The SOARX token is the native currency of the Soarx blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## SOARX utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the Soarx blockchain, SOARX is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake Soarx to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 2500K. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.soarxscan.org/](https://status.soarxscan.org/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked SOARX. Which means validators with higher amounts of Soarx staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any SOARX holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of SOARX they wish. They receive a share of the Soarx block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As SOARX is the native currency on Soarx, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, SOARX transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of SOARX tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the Soarx platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;
