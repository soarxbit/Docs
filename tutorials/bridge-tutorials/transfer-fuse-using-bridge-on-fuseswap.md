Once the transaction is confirmed on chain, the **“Transfer”** can be clicked and transaction has to be approved. Once this second transaction is confirmed onchain the SOARX balance in the same address on Soarx network will have the updated balance of SOARX which can be checked through [www.soarxscan.org](http://www.soarxscan.org/).
